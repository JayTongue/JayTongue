Hello! I'm Justin Tung, a Reference Librarian. Despite not having much of a technical background, I fell in love with computing while doing my Master's in Library and Information Science. I had a few Professors who showed me the ropes of Python, and I've been mostly self-taught ever since.

While I focus on library technology at work, I have a number of tangential interests, I have a ton of other interests as well, and my github is a reflection of that.

I'm interested in:
  * Information Processing
  * Python
  * SQL/Database Management
  * Data Visualization
  * Single-board Computers
  * Microcontrollers
